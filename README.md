Background and Motivation:
The identification and categorization of the tumor is the first step in comprehending the mechanisms that
underlie the development of a brain tumor. However, this process requires much expertise involvement.
For instance, radiologists are required to confidently interpret fMRI imagery for diagnosis, a tedious
process requiring several years of training. Today's deep learning approaches, such CNN and RNN, enable
quick and accurate fMRI image processing, which also offers diagnosis suggestions. The objective of this
study is to create a CNN model that can precisely localize and categorize brain tumors.


Data:
The data we will be using comes from two sources: 1) FIGSHARE
(https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/brain_tumor_dataset/1512427) There are three different types of
brain tumors in this dataset of 3064 T1-weighted contrast-enhanced pictures of brain tumors
(meningioma, glioma, and pituitary). 2) Harvard Medical School the Whole Brain Atlas
(http://www.med.harvard.edu/AANLIB/ &
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14Ogtwrp2R_wpPj1fb_pLF_5z7H7cL2PN?usp=sharing) There are
152 T1 and T2-weighted contrast MRI slices in the dataset (71 healthy and 81 tumor cases). Data cleanup:
These datasets have been substantially cleaned up and are well-labeled; additional data cleanup is
depending on the model embeddings of your choice.


Scope:
In this project, we will be classifying and localizing tumors based on fMRI images using a deep learning
model that was created with the help of convolutional neural networks, more often known as CNNs. This
project will encourage the research of preprocessing techniques like as thresholding, normalization,
erosion, augmentation, and other similar techniques in order to produce the best possible outcomes for
downstream prediction. This project is a fantastic way to get started learning about how artificial
intelligence can be used in the medical industry.
